To protect the raspberry pi zero and the PCB from damage and shorts you can 3D print the enclosure files in this directory.

Designed in FreeCAD. PCB was imported into FreeCAD with the [KiCAD StepUp plugin](https://www.kicad.org/external-tools/stepup/).

Step files can be sliced in e.g. PrusaSlicer.
