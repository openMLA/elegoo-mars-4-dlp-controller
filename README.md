# Raspberry Pi hat for Elegoo Mars 4 DLP board

A hat for the raspberry pi that allows the Elegoo Mars 4 DLP's UV light projector to be controlled. I recommend using a raspberry pi zero 2; as the linear regulator on board doesn't really have enough juice for the Pi 5 or the full size Pi boards.

The UV projector of the Elegoo Mars 4 DLP is [developed and produced by Anhua (D63ZS50B)](https://www.anhuaoe.com/en/industriause/info.aspx?itemid=2694), and seems to be this variety. Under the hood it uses the Texas Instruments DLP300s or DLP301s digital micromirror array.

### Sourcing the Projector

The easiest and cheapest way to source the projector is to buy a Elegoo Mars 4 DLP. At the time of writing (2024-02-02) the resin printer can be purchased in the EU for 275 euro (discounted).

Alternatively, the projector can be purchased directly from Anhua; but there may be small differences in the heatsink, LED source and other items. Also expect to pay a premium due to shipping, broker cost etc.
